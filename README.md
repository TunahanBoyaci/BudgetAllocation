## Overview
The Budget Allocation program is a Java-based tool designed to simplify budget management and expense allocation. By inputting the total budget and proportions for various expense categories, users can obtain a breakdown of the corresponding dollar amounts. The program ensures that the cumulative proportion does not exceed 100% and adjusts the proportions if necessary. With its user-friendly interface and efficient calculations, the Budget Allocation empowers individuals to make informed spending decisions and maintain better control over their finances.
